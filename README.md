# Stock-Price-Predictor
## Predicts the price of a single stock using LSTM (Long short-term memory)<br>
The following model Predicts the price of any given stock (I have taken GOOGL) by using data from previous 3 years.<br>
Of this 3 years of data, 60% is training set, 20% is dev set, and the rest is test set.<br>
This model uses StandardScalar.<br>
## To run this model:<br>
1. Clone this Repository.
2. Download the Dataset of the organization whose stock you want to predict (Preferably of last 3 years atleast) from (https://finance.yahoo.com/)
3. Rename this .csv file to "data.csv"
4. Copy and Replace this file with the existing data.csv file in "data" subfolder.
5. Run the Jupyter notebook.
